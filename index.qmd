Welcome to the portfolio of Pelle Knegjes

I am a motivated MSc Business Information Management student at Rotterdam School of Management, Erasmus University with a background in functional consulting. With experience in collaborating with diverse teams and conducting research, I am skilled in identifying and addressing the needs of organizations. My interests lie in exploring cooperations and contributing to the development of smart and sustainable cities.
