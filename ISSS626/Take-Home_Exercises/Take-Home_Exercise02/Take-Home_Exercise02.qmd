## **Setting the Scene**

Tourism is one of Thailandâ€™s largest industries, accounting for some 20% of the gross domestic product (GDP). In 2019, Thailand earned 90 billion US\$ from domestic and international tourism, but the COVID-19 pandemic caused revenues to crash to 24 billion US\$ in 2020.

## **Objectives**

As a curious geospatial analytics green horn, we are interested to discover:

-   if the key indicators of tourism economy of Thailand are independent from space and space and time.

-   If the tourism economy is indeed spatial and spatio-temporal dependent, then, we would like to detect where are the clusters and outliers, and the emerging hot spot/cold spot areas.

## **The Task**

The specific tasks of this take-home exercise are as follows:

-   Using appropriate function of **sf** and **tidyverse**, preparing the following geospatial data layer:

    -   a study area layer in sf polygon features. It must be at [province level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_of_Thailand) (including Bangkok) of Thailand.

    -   a tourism economy indicators layer within the study area in sf polygon features.

    -   a derived tourism economy indicator layer in [**spacetime s3 class of sfdep**](https://sfdep.josiahparry.com/articles/spacetime-s3). Keep the time series at **month and year levels**.

-   Using the extracted data, perform global spatial autocorrelation analysis by using [sfdep methods](https://is415-gaa-tskam.netlify.app/in-class_ex/in-class_ex05/in-class_ex05-glsa).

-   Using the extracted data, perform local spatial autocorrelation analysis by using [sfdep methods](https://r4gdsa.netlify.app/chap10.html).

-   Using the extracted data, perform emerging hotspot analysis by using [sfdep methods](https://is415-gaa-tskam.netlify.app/in-class_ex/in-class_ex05/in-class_ex05-ehsa).

-   Describe the spatial patterns revealed by the analysis above.

## **The Data**

For the purpose of this take-home exercise, two data sets shall be used, they are:

-   [Thailand Domestic Tourism Statistics](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thaweewatboy/thailand-domestic-tourism-statistics) at Kaggle. You are required to use **version 2** of the data set.

-   [Thailand - Subnational Administrative Boundaries](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/cod-ab-tha?) at HDX. You are required to use the province boundary data set.
